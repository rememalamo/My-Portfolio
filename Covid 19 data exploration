# --In this project, we will be looking at different Covid statistcs, using data through 02/09/2024

--Nigera has a vaccination rate of 43%, while also boasting the lowest death rate of .0014%. For context, the United States had the highest death rate of .34%, while being the 6th most vaccinated country. This shows that vaccination rate and death rate are not correlated, there are more factors at play when it comes to casualites. 
--In this query, I purposefully selected the columns with the total number of vaccinated and killed, instead of only showing the percentages, so that I could verify that the numbers pulled in my query where accurate and up to date.
--I first ran this same query with the order by as "death_rate desc" to find the highest and lowest death rate, before sorting by percentage_vaccinated to find the vaccine percentage for the United States for easier ranking in that regard.
