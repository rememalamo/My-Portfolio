--In this project, I will display different tecniques used in data cleaning

--First, taking a look at the data set
Select *
From `Nashillle_housing.housing`

--I noticed there are a lot of null addresses, so I am going use the parcel ID to force populate the null addresses from other rows where that same parcel ID has the corresponding address.
-- I am going to join the property addresses with different unique IDs, but with the Parcel IDs,to the correct Parcel IDs, thus populating the NULL field.
SELECT a.ParcelID, a.PropertyAddress, b.ParcelId, b.PropertyAddress, IFNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
From `Nashillle_housing.housing`a
JOIN `Nashillle_housing.housing`b
  on a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
  AND a.UniqueID_ <> b.UniqueID_
  Where a.PropertyAddress is null
--Now that we've generated the correct addresses, let's populate the Null Values
Update a
SET PropertyAddress = IFNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
From `Nashillle_housing.housing`a
JOIN `Nashillle_housing.housing`b
  on a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
  AND a.UniqueID_ <> b.UniqueID_
  Where a.PropertyAddress is null

--Next, we will be seperating the property address fields into seperate colums
Select PropertyAddress
FROM `Nashillle_housing.housing`
--The comma is used as the delimeter between address and city, so we will split them at that point.
Select 
(split(PropertyAddress, ','))[safe_ordinal(1)] as address,
(split(PropertyAddress, ','))[safe_ordinal(2)] as city
FROM `Nashillle_housing.housing`

--Now, I will be converting all "FALSE" to "No" and "TRUE" to "Yes"
 SELECT SoldAsVacant,
  CASE
    WHEN SoldAsVacant = TRUE THEN 'Yes'
    WHEN SoldAsVacant = FALSE THEN 'No'
    ELSE SoldAsVacant
    END
FROM `Nashillle_housing.housing` 

--I will now look for any duplicates rows
WITH RowNumCTE AS(
SELECT *,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
    PARTITION BY ParcelID, PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, LegalReference
    ORDER BY UniqueID_) row_number
FROM `Nashillle_housing.housing`)
Select *
FROM RowNumCTE
Where row_number >1
Order by PropertyAddress
--There are 103 duplicate rows

--Finally, I will delete 3 uneccessary columns
ALTER TABLE 'Nashillle_housing.housing`
DROP COLUMN OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress
